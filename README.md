# social-media-code-snippets

I enjoy posting screenshots and snippets of code on social media. Whether it's a cool tip or trick, or simply something I'm proud of coding, code snippets are fun!

I created this repo for accessibility reasons!

Some people may have difficulty consuming content in image form. And when it comes to code screenshots, it can be a bit much to write out every character of a code snippet in an image's "alt" text field.

So from now on, every code screenshot I post will be saved here on GitHub. Then in the description, caption, or replies will be a link to the actual code file in this repo. Therefore anyone can read the code I posted!

Happy Coding :)
